# Software-defect-prediction-CNN-and-RNN
Software defect prediction using recurrent neural network and convolutional neural network
NameGenerator.py is used to generate the names of Java files to be able to locate them
PreProcessing.py used to make the preprocessing part of the Java files
softwareDefectPrediction.ipynb contains the CNN and RNN models and you can run it on GoogleColab
